# Tech Blog

The goal of this project is to create a blog page that can handle multiple users

Users will be able to:
- create a username and password
  - will need login andn log out, create new user
- create a new post
  - select your username from a dropdown menu to select yourself as the author
  - Give the blog a title
  - have a main text area for the blog content
    - put in some sort of helper text like, "penny for your thoughts"
  - save the post with a button
  - _every new entry should have a time stamp for when it was made_ 
    - and who it was posted by

- create an about page
- create a link on home page for your github and linkedin pages

- all posts should have CRUD functionality

### Stretch goals
- when creating a new post, give functionality _on text highlight_ to make the text bold, italic, enter headers (maybe just h1 and h2 to start), add quotations, and add a hyperlink
